# Code Mobility

A library for code mobility with Dart. The library supports the four approaches (see image) of code mobility: *Local execution*, *remote execution*, *code on demand* and *remote evaluation*.
The features are explained in the dartdoc documentation and the [example implementations](https://github.com/dbaelz/code_mobility/blob/master/example).
